# Specification

Last reviewed: 2026-08-22
Current project version: `0.2.12`

The [Roadmap](docs/DRL-Rust_Project_Roadmap.md) owns overall milestone scope,
ordering, and delivery tracking. This file expands **exactly one active
implementation slice** into observable behavior, pure contracts, acceptance
criteria, and verification boundaries.

---

## 1. Status Vocabulary

- `[x]` — **Delivered and Verified**: Supported by checked repository evidence,
  tests, or artifacts.
- `[ ]` — **Present or Future Work**: Open implementation task or acceptance
  gate.
- `NOT_RUN` — **Environment Unavailable**: Required prerequisites (e.g., Linux
  x86-64 binary or browser WebGPU) were not present; not an inferred pass.
- `INCONCLUSIVE` — **Unresolved Evidence**: Output exists but cannot
  definitively satisfy criteria without additional evidence.

## 2. Active Implementation Slice: M10 Browser-Save Corruption Recovery

### 2.1 Scope & Objective

Make rejected browser save data recoverable without silently discarding it.
Invalid, unsupported, oversized, or replay-invalid command-history tokens are
quarantined in a bounded browser-owned slot, removed from the active load path,
and reported while the live session remains playable. Explicit version-aware
migration remains a future slice.

### 2.2 Predecessor Foundation (Delivered Slices)

1. **Fixed-session snapshot (v0.2.11)**:
   - `BrowserSession::snapshot_token` encodes accepted semantic commands from
     the fixed M4 session.
   - `restore_snapshot` decodes and replays into a fresh session before commit,
     so failed restores cannot partially mutate active state.
2. **Storage boundary (v0.2.11)**:
   - WASM `localStorage` helpers save, load, and clear one namespaced token.
   - Accepted commands autosave best-effort and report storage failures without
     rejecting gameplay.

### 2.3 Present Slice Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Fail-closed restore**: Invalid snapshot data leaves the active
  `BrowserSession` unchanged.
- [x] **Bounded quarantine**: Rejected values are recorded in a separate
  bounded diagnostic slot, then removed from the active storage key when the
  browser permits both operations.
- [x] **Playable recovery**: Boot and explicit load report rejection and keep
  renderer, input, and simulation available even when storage recovery fails.
- [x] **Native contract tests**: Cover bounded quarantine records and active
  session immutability after malformed restore.
- [ ] **Migration gate**: Unknown versions/content remain rejected; an
  explicit replay-compatible migration table is future work.

### 2.4 Pure Contract

- **Input**: A browser-owned snapshot token and the current fixed-session
  `BrowserSession`.
- **Output**: Either a transactionally restored session or a bounded rejected
  record plus a recoverable status; no invalid token is replayed.
- **Ownership Boundary**:
  - `drl-web` owns token storage, quarantine, and future migration policy.
  - `drl-core` remains authoritative for replayed simulation semantics.
  - JavaScript receives status text only, never authoritative game state.

## 3. Recent Delivered Slices

### M10 — Browser-Save Corruption Recovery (`VERSION` 0.2.12)

- [x] Quarantined malformed, unsupported, oversized, and replay-invalid save
  values in a bounded browser-owned diagnostic slot.

  limits.

### M8 — Particle-Decal Insertion Request (`VERSION` 0.2.9)

- [x] Packaged accepted placement coordinates with caller-provided sprite ID.
- [x] Reused checked placement and eligibility math without duplicate logic.
- [x] Preserved legacy cell, pixel offset, and sprite ID representations.

### M12 — Release Hardening & Integrity (`VERSION` 0.2.1)

- [x] Git checkout-identity binding in release manifest generator.
- [x] Release manifest SHA-256 sidecar (`release-manifest.sha256`).
- [x] Versioned service-worker cache invalidation based on version and commit.
- [x] Mocked service worker lifecycle and fetch contract test harness.
- [x] Static HTML shell accessibility audit (landmarks, focus, live regions).

### M11 — Cohort Telemetry & Outcome Projections (`VERSION` 0.1.1–0.2.3)

- [x] Fixed-seed cohort reports (`CohortConfig`, `CohortReport`) with integrity
  validation.
- [x] Cohort outcome distributions (victory, death, turn limit, stalled, in
  progress).
- [x] Pure outcome-rate and telemetry tolerance gates for regression detection.
- [x] Descriptive telemetry metrics: shot accuracy, damage dealt/taken, kills,
  pickups, and item usage.

## 4. Shared Observable Behavior & Invariants

### 4.1 Simulation & Fairness

- **Information Decoupling**: `BrowserSession` and MCP tools expose only fair
  `PlayerObservation` and `GameEvent` streams. Hidden world state is never
  accessible.
- **Replay Determinism**: Identical seed and command sequences produce bit-exact
  identical events and end states across headless, MCP, and browser runners.
- **Transactional Rollback**: Rejected or illegal commands roll back session
  state without advancing the simulation turn or consuming energy.

### 4.2 Browser & WebGPU Presentation

- **Input Translation**: Browser shell maps keyboard/numpad, wait, pickup,
  reload, descend, ranged targeting, and DOM inventory clicks directly to
  protocol `Command`s.
- **No Simulation Side Effects**: Canvas resize, DPR change, animation tick,
  audio playback, tab visibility change, or WebGPU device loss never advance
  simulation time.
- **Square-Cell Viewport**: Integer scaling and centering ensure square game
  tiles without non-uniform axis stretching.
- **Visibility-Derived Lighting**: Full light for tiles in active FOV; fixed fog
  factor for remembered explored tiles. Presentation never queries hidden
  tiles.

### 4.3 Evaluation & Telemetry

- **Contiguous Seeds**: Cohort reports record contiguous seed ranges and
  preserve per-seed replay logs.
- **Descriptive Metrics**: Projections report descriptive counts and rates; they
  do not assert balance conclusions or statistical significance.

### 4.4 Release Packaging

- **Manifest Validation**: Release scripts verify manifest schema, sorted
  SHA-256 hashes, license metadata, worker coverage, sidecar digests, and source
  commit identity.

## 5. Public Contracts & Boundaries

### 5.1 Protocol & Simulation (`drl-protocol`, `drl-core`)

- **Domain Types**: `Position`, `Direction`, `Turn`, `EntityId`, `ItemId`,
  `LevelId`, `HitPoints`, `Speed`, `ActionCost`.
- **Commands**: `Command::Move`, `Command::Wait`, `Command::Pickup`,
  `Command::Drop`, `Command::Equip`, `Command::Unequip`, `Command::Reload`,
  `Command::Use`, `Command::AttackMelee`, `Command::AttackRanged`,
  `Command::Descend`.
- **Observations**: `PlayerObservation` (FOV tiles, visible actors, ground
  items, inventory, equipment, player HP, map dimensions).
- **Events**: `GameEvent::AttackResolved`, `GameEvent::DamageApplied`,
  `GameEvent::ActorDied`, `GameEvent::ActorKnockedBack`,
  `GameEvent::PlayerTeleported`, `GameEvent::LevelTransitioned`, etc.

### 5.2 Presentation & Assets (`drl-render`, `drl-assets`, `drl-web`)

- **Layout**: `PixelViewport`, `PixelRect`, integer cell scaling.
- **Shading & Tone**: `LightingBand`, `shade_color`, `SceneTone`,
  `low_health_pulse_target_alpha`, `LowHealthPulseState`.
- **Draw Plans**: `layer_draw_plan`, `sprite_composite_plan`, `LayerRole`,
  `AtlasTextureSource`.
- **Decals & Particles**: `ParticleDecalPlacement`, `ParticleDecalInsertion`,
  `ParticleDecalStore`, burst origins/directions/ranges.

### 5.3 Decoupling Invariants

- `drl-core` and `drl-protocol` have **zero** dependencies on WebGPU, Web
  Audio, DOM, filesystem, network, or MCP crates.

  capture manifests.
- [x] `sh scripts/check-web.sh` — WASM target compilation and native/WASM web
  contract tests.
- [x] `sh scripts/build-web.sh && sh scripts/check-release-manifest.sh` — Static
  bundle build and 44-artifact manifest validation.
- [x] `scripts/check-version.sh` — Project version consistency and transition

## 7. Explicit Non-Goals

- **Pre-1.0 Multiplatform**: No WebGL2 fallback, mobile/touch UI, gamepad
  navigation, or native desktop packaging before the 1.0 desktop Chromium
  release.
- **No Runtime Scripting**: No Lua VM or JavaScript gameplay logic. All
  simulation is pure compiled Rust.
- **No Online Services**: No player accounts, multiplayer networking, or
  remote backend servers.
- **No Unattributed Assets**: No bundling of legacy audio, music, or fonts
  without documented redistribution rights.
- **No False Parity Claims**: Pure mathematical contracts and generated audio
  tones are not claimed as full legacy audiovisual equivalence until validated
  against reference captures.
